You are given a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, initially, vertex i has value W_i. The value of each vertex can be either -1 or a non-negative integer.

At any time, let's denote the sequence of values of vertices on the path from vertex u to vertex v by S(u, v). We are interested in replacing each element -1 in such a sequence by a non-negative integer (not necessarily the same for each -1).

You should process Q queries of five types:
- UPDATE U X: Change the value of vertex U to X.
- INCREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each -1 in the sequence S(U, V) by an integer between A and B (inclusive) such that the resulting sequence is strictly increasing.
- DECREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each -1 in the sequence S(U, V) by an integer between A and B (inclusive) such that the resulting sequence is strictly decreasing.
- NON-DECREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each -1 in the sequence S(U, V) by an integer between A and B (inclusive) such that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing.
- NON-INCREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each -1 in the sequence S(U, V) by an integer between A and B (inclusive) such that the resulting sequence is non-increasing.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers W_1, W_2, ..., W_N.
- Each of the next N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers U and V denoting that vertices U and V are connected by an edge.
- Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the format given above.

### Output
For each query except the UPDATE queries, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of ways to replace each -1, modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Constraints
- 1 < N, Q < 10^5
- 1 < U, V < N
- -1 < W_i < 10^6 for each valid i
- 0 < A < B < 10^6
- -1 < X < 10^6

### Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): 1 < N, Q < 1,000

Subtask #2 (10 points):
- W_i = -1 for each valid i
- X = -1

Subtask #3 (80 points): original constraints
