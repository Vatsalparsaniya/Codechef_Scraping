There are N caves in a row, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the radiation power in the i-th cave is C_i. Originally, the radiation level in each cave was 0. Then, for each valid i, the radiation power in cave i increased the radiation levels in the caves i-C_i, ..., i+C_i inclusive (if they exist) by 1, so all the caves are radioactive now.

Radiation is not the only problem, though. There are also N zombies with health levels H_1, H_2, ..., H_N. You want to kill all of them by getting them to the caves in such a way that there is exactly one zombie in each cave. A zombie dies in a cave if and only if the radiation level in that cave is equal to the health level of the zombie. Is it possible to kill all the zombies?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers C_1, C_2, ..., C_N.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers H_1, H_2, ..., H_N.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to kill all the zombies or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).

### Constraints 
- 1 < T < 100
- 1 < N < 10^5
- 1 < C_i, H_i < 10^9 for each valid i

### Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1 < N < 1,000

Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

5 4 3 4 5


### Example Output

NO
YES


### Explanation
In both example test cases, the final radiation levels in the caves are (5, 5, 4, 4, 3). For example, the radiation power in cave 1 increased the radiation levels in caves 1 and 2 (there is no cave 0) by 1, and the radiation power in cave 4 increased the radiation levels in all caves by 1.
